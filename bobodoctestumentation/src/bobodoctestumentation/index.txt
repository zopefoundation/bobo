Introduction
============

Bobo is a light-weight framework for creating `WSGI
<http://wsgi.org>`_ web applications.

Its goal is to be easy to learn and remember.

It provides 2 features:

- Mapping URLs to objects

- Calling objects to generate HTTP responses

It doesn't have a templating language, a database integration layer,
or a number of other features that can be provided by WSGI middle-ware
or application-specific libraries.

Bobo builds on other frameworks, most notably WSGI and `WebOb
<http://pythonpaste.org/webob/>`_.

.. _installation:

Installation
============

Bobo can be installed in the usual ways, including using the `setup.py
install command
<http://docs.python.org/install/index.html#the-new-standard-distutils>`_.
You can, of course, use `Easy Install
<http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall>`_, `Buildout
<http://www.buildout.org>`_, or `pip <http://pip.openplans.org/>`_.

To use the setup.py install command, download and unpack the `source
distribution <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/bobo>`_ and run the setup
script::

  python setup.py install

To run bobo's tests, just use the test command::

  python setup.py test

You can do this before or after installation.

Bobo works with Python 2.4, 2.5, and 2.6.  Python 3.0 support is planned.
Of course, when using Python 2.4 and 2.5, class decorator syntax can't
be used. You can still use the decorators by calling them with a class
after a class is created.

Getting Started
===============

Let's create a minimal web application, "hello world". We'll put it in
a file named "hello.py"::

    import bobo

    @bobo.query
    def hello():
        return "Hello world!"

.. -> src

    >>> update_module('helloapp', src)

    >>> import webob, webtest, bobo
    >>> app = webtest.TestApp(bobo.Application(bobo_resources='helloapp'))

This application creates a single web resource, "/hello.html", that simply
outputs the text "Hello world".

Bobo decorators, like ``bobo.query`` used in the example above
control how URLs are mapped to objects. They also control how
functions are called and returned values converted to web responses.
If a function returns a string, it's assumed to be HTML and used to
construct a response.  You can control the content type used by
passing a content_type keyword argument to the decorator.

Let's try out our application.  Assuming that bobo's installed, you
can run the application on port 8080 using [#bobooptions]_::

    bobo -f hello.py

This will start a web server running on localhost port 8080.  If you
visit::

    http://localhost:8080/hello.html

.. -> url
  >>> url = url.strip()

you'll get the greeting::

    Hello world!

.. -> expected_body
  >>> expected_body = expected_body.strip()

    >>> app.get(url, status=200).body == expected_body
    True

The URL we used to access the application was determined by the name
of the resource function and the content type used by the decorator,
which defaults to "text/html; charset=UTF-8". Let's change the
application so we can use a URL like::

    http://localhost:8080/

.. -> url
  >>> url = url.strip()

We'll do this by providing a URL path::

    @bobo.query('/')
    def hello():
        return "Hello world!"

.. -> src

    >>> update_module('helloapp', src)
    >>> app = webtest.TestApp(bobo.Application(bobo_resources='helloapp'))
    >>> app.get(url, status=200).body == expected_body
    True

Here, we passed a path to the ``query`` decorator.  We used a '/'
string, which makes a URL like the one above work. (We also omitted
the import for brevity.)

We don't need to restart the server to see our changes.  The bobo
development server automatically reloads the file if it changes.

As its name suggests, the ``query`` decorator is meant to work with
resources that return information, possibly using form data.  Let's
modify the application to allow the name of the person to greet to be
given as form data::

    @bobo.query('/')
    def hello(name="world"):
        return "Hello %s!" % name

.. -> src

    >>> update_module('helloapp', src)
    >>> app = webtest.TestApp(bobo.Application(bobo_resources='helloapp'))
    >>> app.get(url, status=200).body == expected_body
    True

If a function accepts named arguments, then data will be
supplied from form data.  If we visit::

    http://localhost:8080/?name=Sally

.. -> url
  >>> url = url.strip()

We'll get the output::

   Hello Sally!

.. -> expected_body
  >>> expected_body = expected_body.strip()

    >>> app.get(url, status=200).body == expected_body
    True

The ``query`` decorator will accept ``GET``, ``POST`` and ``HEAD``
requests. It's appropriate when server data aren't modified.  To
accept form data and modify data on a server, you should use the ``post``
decorator. The ``post`` decorator works like the ``query`` decorator
accept that it only allows ``POST`` and ``PUT`` requests and won't pass data
provided in a query string as function arguments.

::

    @bobo.post('/')
    def hello(name="world"):
        return "Hello %s!" % name

.. -> src

    >>> update_module('helloapp', src)
    >>> app = webtest.TestApp(bobo.Application(bobo_resources='helloapp'))
    >>> app.post('/', 'name=Bob', status=200)
    <200 OK text/html body='Hello Bob!'>
    >>> app.put('/', 'name=Bob', status=200)
    <200 OK text/html body='Hello Bob!'>

    >>> response = app.get(url, status=405)
    >>> response.headers['Allow']
    'POST, PUT'
    >>> print response.body,
    <html>
    <head><title>Method Not Allowed</title></head>
    <body>Invalid request method: GET</body>
    </html>

The ``query`` and ``post`` decorators are convenient when you want to just get
user input passed as function arguments.  If you want a bit more
control, you can also get the request object by defining a
``bobo_request`` parameter::

    @bobo.query('/')
    def hello(bobo_request, name="world"):
        return "Hello %s! (method=%s)" % (name, bobo_request.method)

.. -> src

    >>> update_module('helloapp', src)
    >>> app = webtest.TestApp(bobo.Application(bobo_resources='helloapp'))
    >>> app.get('/', status=200).body
    'Hello world! (method=GET)'

The request object gives full access to all of the form data, as well
as other information, such as cookies and input headers.

The ``query`` and ``post`` decorators introspect the function they're
applied to. This means they can't be used with callable objects that
don't provide function meta data.  There's a low-level decorator,
``resource`` that does no introspection and can be used with any
callable::

    @bobo.resource('/')
    def hello(request):
        name = request.params.get('name', 'world!')
        return "Hello %s!" % name

.. -> src

    >>> update_module('helloapp', src)
    >>> app = webtest.TestApp(bobo.Application(bobo_resources='helloapp'))
    >>> app.get('/?name=Bob', status=200).body
    'Hello Bob!'

The ``resource`` decorator always passes the request object as the first
positional argument to the callable it's given.

Automatic response generation
==============================

The :func:`resource`, :func:`post`, and :func:`query` decorators
provide automatic response generation when the value returned by an
application isn't a :term:`response` object.  The generation
of the response is controlled by the content type given to the
``content_type`` decorator parameter.

If an application returns a string, then a response is
constructed using the string with the content type.

If an application doesn't return a response or a string, then the
handling depends on whether or not the content type is
``'application/json``. For ``'application/json``, the returned value
is marshalled to JSON using the ``json`` (or ``simplejson``) module, if
present.  If the module isn't importable, or if marshaling fails, then
an exception will be raised.

If an application returns a unicode string and the content type
isn't ``'application/json'``, the string is encoded using the
character set given in the content_type, or using the UTF-8
encoding, if the content type doesn't include a charset
parameter.

If an application returns a non-response non-string result and
the content type isn't ``'application/json'``, then an
exception is raised.

If an application wants greater control over a response, it will
generally want to construct a `webob.Response
<http://pythonpaste.org/webob/reference.html#id2>`_ object and return
that.

.. _routes:

Routes
======

We saw earlier that we could control the URLs used to access resources
by passing a path to a decorator. The path we pass can specify a
multi-level URL and can have placeholders, which allow us to pass data
to the resource as part of the URL.

Here, we modify the hello application to let us pass the name of the
greeter in the URL::

    @bobo.query('/greeters/:myname')
    def hello(name="world", myname='Bobo'):
        return "Hello %s! My name is %s." % (name, myname)

.. -> src

    >>> update_module('helloapp', src)
    >>> app = webtest.TestApp(bobo.Application(bobo_resources='helloapp'))

Now, to access the resource, we use a URL like::

    http://localhost:8080/greeters/myapp?name=Sally

.. -> url
  >>> url = url.strip()

for which we get the output::

    Hello Sally! My name is myapp.

.. -> expected_body
  >>> expected_body = expected_body.strip()

    >>> app.get(url).body == expected_body
    True

We call these paths :term:`routes` because they use a syntax inspired
loosely by the `Ruby on Rails Routing
<http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionController/Routing.html>`_
system.

You can have any number of placeholders or constant URL paths in a
route.  The values associated with the placeholders will be made
available as function arguments.

If a placeholder is followed by a question mark, then the route
segment is optional.  If we change the hello example::

    @bobo.query('/greeters/:myname?')
    def hello(name="world", myname='Bobo'):
        return "Hello %s! My name is %s." % (name, myname)

.. -> src

    >>> update_module('helloapp', src)
    >>> app = webtest.TestApp(bobo.Application(bobo_resources='helloapp'))

we can use the URL::

    http://localhost:8080/greeters?name=Sally

.. -> url
  >>> url = url.strip()

for which we get the output::

    Hello Sally! My name is Bobo.

.. -> expected_body
  >>> expected_body = expected_body.strip()

    >>> app.get(url).body == expected_body
    True

Note, however, if we use the URL::

    http://localhost:8080/greeters/?name=Sally

.. -> url
  >>> url = url.strip()

we get the output::

    Hello Sally! My name is .

.. -> expected_body
  >>> expected_body = expected_body.strip()

    >>> app.get(url).body == expected_body
    True

Placeholders must be legal Python identifiers.  A placeholder may be
followed by an extension.  For example, we could use::

    @bobo.query('/greeters/:myname.html')
    def hello(name="world", myname='Bobo'):
        return "Hello %s! My name is %s." % (name, myname)

.. -> src

    >>> update_module('helloapp', src)
    >>> app = webtest.TestApp(bobo.Application(bobo_resources='helloapp'))

Here, we've said that the name must have an ".html" suffix.  To access
the function, we use a URL like::

    http://localhost:8080/greeters/myapp.html?name=Sally

.. -> url
  >>> url = url.strip()

And get::

    Hello Sally! My name is myapp.

.. -> expected_body
  >>> expected_body = expected_body.strip()

    >>> app.get(url).body == expected_body
    True

If the placeholder is optional::

    @bobo.query('/greeters/:myname?.html')
    def hello(name="world", myname='Bobo'):
        return "Hello %s! My name is %s." % (name, myname)

.. -> src

    >>> update_module('helloapp', src)
    >>> app = webtest.TestApp(bobo.Application(bobo_resources='helloapp'))

Then we can use a URL like::

    http://localhost:8080/greeters?name=Sally

.. -> url
  >>> url = url.strip()

    >>> app.get(url, status=200).body
    'Hello Sally! My name is Bobo.'

or::

    http://localhost:8080/greeters/jim.html?name=Sally

.. -> url
  >>> url = url.strip()

    >>> app.get(url, status=200).body
    'Hello Sally! My name is jim.'


Subroutes
---------

Sometimes, you want to split URL matching into multiple steps.  You
might do this to provide cleaner abstractions in your application, or
to support more flexible resource organization.  You can use the
subroute decorator to do this.  The subroute decorator decorates a
callable object that returns a resource.  The subroute uses the given
route to match the beginning of the request path.  The resource
returned by the callable is matched against the remainder of the
path. Let's look at an example::

    import bobo

    database = {
       '1': dict(
            name='Bob',
            documents = {
              'hi.html': "Hi. I'm Bob.",
              'hobbies': {
                'cooking.html': "I like to cook.",
                'sports.html': "I like to ski.",
                },
              },
            ),
    }

    @bobo.subroute('/employees/:employee_id', scan=True)
    class Employees:

        def __init__(self, request, employee_id):
            self.employee_id = employee_id
            self.data = database[employee_id]

        @bobo.resource('')
        def base(self, request):
            return bobo.redirect(request.url+'/')

        @bobo.query('/')
        @bobo.query('/summary.html')
        def summary(self):
            return """
            id: %s
            name: %s
            See my <a href="documents">documents</a>.
            """ % (self.employee_id, self.data['name'])

        @bobo.query('/details.html')
        def details(self):
            "Show employee details"
            # ...

        @bobo.post('/update.html')
        def add(self, name, phone, fav_color):
            "Update employee data"
            # ...

        @bobo.subroute
        def documents(self, request):
            return Folder(self.data['documents'])

.. -> src

    >>> import sys
    >>> if sys.version_info < (2, 6):
    ...     src = src.replace("\n@bobo.subroute", "\n#bobo.subroute")
    ...     src += ("\nEmployees = bobo.subroute("
    ...             "'/employees/:employee_id', scan=True)(Employees)")

    >>> update_module('helloapp', src)
    >>> app = webtest.TestApp(bobo.Application(bobo_resources='helloapp'))

With this example, if we visit::

    http://localhost:8080/employees/1/summary.html

.. -> url
  >>> url = url.strip()

    >>> print app.get(url).body
    <BLANKLINE>
            id: 1
            name: Bob
            See my <a href="documents">documents</a>.
    <BLANKLINE>

We'll get the summary for a user.  The URL will be matched in 2
steps. First, the path ``/employees/1`` will match the subroute.  The
class is called with the request and employee id. Then the routes
defined for the individual methods are searched.  The remainder of the
path, ``/summary.html``, matches the route for the summary
method. (Note that we provided two decorators for the summary method,
which allows us to get to it two ways.)  The methods were scanned for
routes because we used the ``scan`` keyword argument.

The ``base`` method has a route that is an empty string. This is a special
case that handles an empty path after matching a subroute.  The base
method will be called for a URL like::

    http://localhost:8080/employees/1

.. -> url
  >>> url = url.strip()

which would redirect to::

    http://localhost:8080/employees/1/

.. -> expected_location
  >>> expected_location = expected_location.strip()

    >>> response = app.get(url, status=302)
    >>> response.headers['location'] == expected_location
    True

The ``documents`` method defines another subroute. Because we left off the
route path, the method name is used.  This returns a Folder
instance. Let's look at the Folder class::

    @bobo.scan_class
    class Folder:

        def __init__(self, data):
            self.data = data

        @bobo.query('')
        def base(self, bobo_request):
            return bobo.redirect(bobo_request.url+'/')

        @bobo.query('/')
        def index(self):
            return '\n'.join('<a href="%s">%s<a><br>' % (k, k)
                             for k in self.data)

        @bobo.subroute('/:item_id')
        def subitem(self, request, item_id):
            item = self.data[item_id]
            if isinstance(item, dict):
               return Folder(item)
            else:
               return Document(item)

    @bobo.scan_class
    class Document:

        def __init__(self, text):
            self.text = text

        @bobo.query('')
        def get(self):
            return self.text

.. -> src

    >>> update_module('helloapp', src)
    >>> app = webtest.TestApp(bobo.Application(bobo_resources='helloapp'))

    Test base: and index:

    >>> app.get('http://localhost:8080/employees/1', status=302
    ...         ).headers['location']
    'http://localhost:8080/employees/1/'

    >>> print app.get('http://localhost:8080/employees/1/', status=200).body,
    <BLANKLINE>
            id: 1
            name: Bob
            See my <a href="documents">documents</a>.
    <BLANKLINE>


The ``Folder`` and ``Document`` classes use the ``scan_class``
decorator. The ``scan_class`` class decorator scans a class to make
routes defined for it's methods available.  Using the ``scan_class``
decorator is equivalent to using the ``scan`` keyword with
``subroute`` decorator [#whyscan]_.  Now consider a URL::

    http://localhost:8080/employees/1/documents/hobbies/sports.html

.. -> url
  >>> url = url.strip()

which outputs::

    I like to ski.

.. -> expected_body
  >>> expected_body = expected_body.strip()

    >>> app.get(url).body == expected_body
    True

The URL is matched in multiple steps:

1. The path ``/employees/1`` matches the ``Employees`` class.

2. The path ``/documents`` matches the ``documents`` method, which returns
   a ``Folder`` using the employee documents dictionary.

3. The path ``/hobbies`` matches the ``subitem`` method of the ``Folder``
   class, which returns the ``hobbies`` dictionary from the documents folder.

4. The path ``/sports.html`` also matches the ``subitem`` ``Folder`` method,
   which returns a ``Document`` using the text for the ``sports.html`` key.

5, The empty path matches the ``get`` method of the ``Document`` class.

Of course, the employee document tree can be arbitrarily deep.

The ``subroute`` decorator can be applied to any callable object that
takes a request and route data and returns a resource.

Methods and REST
----------------

When we define a resource, we can also specify the HTTP methods it will
handle.  The ``resource`` and ``query`` decorators will handle GET, HEAD and
POST methods by default. The ``post`` decorator handles POST and PUT methods.
You can specify one or more methods when using the ``resource``,
``query``, and ``post`` decorators::

    @bobo.resource(method='GET')
    def hello(who='world'):
        return "Hello %s!" % who

    @bobo.resource(method=['GET', 'HEAD'])
    def hello2(who='world'):
        return "Hello %s!" % who


.. -> src

    At least make sure the function defs execute:

    >>> update_module('helloapp', src)

If multiple resources (resource, query, or post) in a module or class
have the same route strings, the resource used will be selected based
on both the route and the methods allowed. (If multiple resources match
a request, the first one defined will be used [#order]_.)

::

    @bobo.subroute('/employees/:employeeid')
    class Employee:

        def __init__(self, request, employee_id):
            self.request = request
            self.id = employee_id

        @bobo.resource('', 'PUT')
        def put(self, request):
            "Save employee data"

        @bobo.post('')
        def new_employee(self):
            "Add an employee"

        @bobo.query('', 'GET')
        def get(self, request):
            "Get employee data"

        @bobo.resource('/resume', 'PUT')
        def save_resume(self, request):
            "Save employee data"

        @bobo.query('/resume')
        def resume(self):
            "Save employee data"

.. -> src

    At least make sure the class def executes:

    >>> if sys.version_info < (2, 6):
    ...     src = src.replace("@bobo.subroute", "\n#bobo.subroute")

    >>> update_module('helloapp', src)

The ability to provide handlers for specific methods provides support
for the `REST architectural style
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer>`_.

.. _configuration:

Beyond the bobo development server
==================================

The bobo server makes it easy to get started.  Just run it with a
source file and off you go.  When you're ready to deploy your
application, you'll want to put your source code in an importable
Python module (or package). Bobo publishes modules, not source
files. The bobo server provides the convenience of converting a source
file to a module.

The bobo command-line server is convenient for getting
started, but production applications will usually be configured with
selected servers and middleware using `Paste Deployment
<http://pythonpaste.org/deploy/>`_. Bobo includes a Paste Deployment
application implementation.  To use bobo with Paste Deployment, simply
define an application section using the bobo egg::

    [app:main]
    use = egg:bobo
    bobo_resources = helloapp
    bobo_configure = helloapp:config
    employees_database = /home/databases/employees.db

    [server:main]
    use = egg:Paste#http
    host = localhost
    port = 8080

In this example, we're using the HTTP `server that is built into Paste
<http://pythonpaste.org/modules/httpserver.html>`_.

The application section (``app:main``) contains bobo options, as well
as application-specific options.  In this example, we used the
``bobo_resources`` option to specify that we want to use resources
found in the helloapp module, and the ``bobo_configure`` option to
specify a configuration handler to be called with configuration data.

You can put application-specific options in the application section,
which can be used by configuration handlers.  You can provide one or
more configuration handlers using the bobo_configure option.  Each
configuration handler is specified as a module name and global name
[#globalexpr]_ separated by a colon.

Configuration handlers are called with a mapping object containing
options from the application section and from the DEFAULT section, if
present, with application options taking precedence.

To start the server, you'll run the paster script installed with
PasteScript and specify the name of your configuration file::

    paster serve app.ini

You'll need to install `Paste Script
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/PasteScript>`_ to use bobo with Paste Deployment.

See :ref:`wikiapaste` for a complete example.

.. [#bobooptions] You can use the ``-p`` option to control the port
   used. To find out more about the bobo server, use the ``-h`` option
   or see :ref:`boboserver`.

.. [#whyscan] You might be wondering why we require the scan keyword in
   the subroute decorator to scan methods for resources.  The reason
   is that scan_class is somewhat invasive. It adds a instance method
   to the class, which may override an existing method. This should
   not be done implicitly.

.. [#order] More precisely, the resource with the lowest :term:`order`
   will be used.  By default, a resources order is determined by the
   order of definition.  You can override the order by passing an
   ``order`` keyword argument to a decorator. See :ref:`orderl`.

.. [#globalexpr] The name can be any Python expression that doesn't
